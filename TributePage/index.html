        Carl Sagan was one of the most iconic astronomers and science communicators of the 20th century. A pioneer in exobiology, he championed the idea of searching for life beyond Earth and played a key role in NASA's Mariner, Viking, Voyager, and Galileo missions. His innovative work in planetary science expanded humanity's understanding of the cosmos and the potential for extraterrestrial life.

        Sagan was not only a brilliant scientist but also a gifted storyteller who brought science to the public. His book *Cosmos*, which accompanied the groundbreaking television series of the same name, is considered one of the best science books ever written. Through his eloquent words and compelling visuals, Sagan inspired a generation to gaze up at the stars and seek answers to humanity's biggest questions.

        As a lifelong advocate for scientific skepticism and rational thinking, Sagan emphasized the importance of questioning, evidence-based reasoning, and critical inquiry. His famous saying, "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence," remains a guiding principle in science.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite his passing in 1996, Sagan's legacy endures through his work, books, and influence on popular science communication. His vision of a united humanity exploring the cosmos continues to inspire scientists and dreamers worldwide.
